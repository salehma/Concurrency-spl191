# Concurrency-spl191

implemented a simple Micro-Service framework, which we
will then use to implement an online book store with a delivery option. The Micro-Services architecture
has become quite popular in recent years. In the Micro-Services architecture, complex applications are
composed of small and independent services which are able to communicate with each other using
messages. The Micro-Service architecture allows us to compose a large program from a collection of
smaller independent parts.
This assignment is composed of two main sections:
1. Building a simple Micro-Service framework.
2. Implementing an online books store application on top of this framework.
